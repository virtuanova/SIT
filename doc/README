About Support Incident Tracker
------------------------------
Support Incident Tracker (SiT!) grew out of an application developed
by Salford Software called Webtrack which is used internally to
manage support incidents.

SiT! is a web-based application that manages various aspects of a
technical support department, the main purpose is to record dealings
with customers while providing support.

Maintainer:
    Ivan Lucas <ivan[at]sitracker.org>

Security Recommendations
------------------------
    * We *strongly* recommend that you make sure your php.ini has
      register_globals set OFF, this has been the default since
      PHP 4.2.0.


Installing
----------

    Requirements:
        A web server (Apache recommended)
        PHP >= 5.1 (Released November 2005)
        MySQL >= 4.1 (Released October 2004)

    Instructions:

        - Copy the files to a directory on your web server

        - (optionally) Make the main sit/ directory your web root

        - In your browser visit setup.php which will prompt you
          for a few important settings and take you through the
          process of creating the database schema

        - setup.php will prompt you to add an admin account,
          make a note of the password you choose for this account

        - Now visit index.php in your browser and login using
          'admin' as the username and the password that you
          chose during setup

        - Within sit go to SiT! -> Control Panel -> Manage Users
          -> Add User to create more users


Configuring
-----------
After you've run setup.php and installed SiT! you should make the
config.inc.php in your main SiT directory read-only.

Most SiT configuration can now be done through the web interface, log in
with an admin account and visit SiT! -> Control Panel -> Configure


Upgrading
---------
See the UPGRADE file for instructions


Regular Scheduled Tasks
-----------------------
SiT! has a script called auto.php that you should run periodically via
a crontab or other method. (e.g. http://www.webcron.org/)

The auto.php script can be run via HTTP or from the console.

An example crontab might look like this:
* * * * * /usr/bin/php -f /var/www/sit/auto.php

The actual schedule is now configured within SiT itself by going
to SiT! -> Control Panel -> Scheduler.
