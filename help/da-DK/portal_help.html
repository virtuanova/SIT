<h3><a name='about'>About Support Incident Tracker</a></h3>
<p>Support Incident Tracker (or SiT!) is a web based application for tracking technical support calls/emails.
Manage contacts, sites, technical support contracts and support incidents in one place. Send and receive emails
directly from SiT!, attach files and record every communication in the incident log. SiT is aware of Service Level
Agreements and incidents are flagged if they stray outside of them.</p>


<h3><a name='incidents'>Incidents</a></h3>
<p>As is clear from the name Support <em>Incident</em> tracker, incidents are an important part of SiT!, 'Incident'
is the name we use for what may also be referred to as a 'support call'. 'service request' or 'helpdesk ticket'.</p>
<p>Incidents are usually referred to by their reference number, what we call the 'Incident Number'.  Incidents
have a title, an associated product, contract and contact and possibly other information as well.</p>
<p>After an incident is added it is always 'owned' by a SiT! user although the user can reassign this ownership while the
incident is open.</p>
<p>Each incident has a current status which may be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active</li>
<li>Closed</li>
<li>Researching</li>
<li>Called And Left Message</li>
<li>Internal Escalation</li>
<li>External Escalation</li>
<li>Awaiting Closure</li>
<li>Awaiting Your Response</li>
<li>Unsupported</li>
</ul>

<p>Closed incidents have an additional closing status:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sent Information</li>
<li>Solved Problem</li>
<li>Reported Bug</li>
<li>Action Taken</li>
<li>Duplicate</li>
<li>No Longer Relevant</li>
<li>Unsupported</li>
<li>Support Expired</li>
<li>Unsolved</li>
<li>Escalated</li>
</ul>

<p>Each incident has an 'updates log' which shows everything that has happened during the lifetime of the incident,
a complete record of all contact with the customer, with colleagues and with external engineers.</p>
<p>Incidents can also have files attached.</p>
